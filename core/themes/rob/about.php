slightly modified from <a

on GitHub, and is available as <a

<h2>About image-dropbox</h2>

<div id="about">
<p>Weekend project to implement an image storage system entirely in database form. The project has expanded well beyond the original few hours I put into it. At this point it is becoming a rather feature rich image hosting platform. Feel free to browse and use the source code at <a href="http://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox/">GitHub</a>. If you do use my code it would be nice if you let me know.</p>
<p>Future features and current bugs viewable at:<br/> <a href="http://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox/issues/">http://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox/issues/</a></p>
