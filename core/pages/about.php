<div id="about">
Weekend project to implement an image storage system entirely in database form. The project has expanded well beyond the original few hours I put into it. At this point it is becoming a rather feature rich image hosting platform. Feel free to browse and use the source code at <a href="http://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox/">GitHub</a>. If you do use my code please give credit and it would be nice if you let me know.
