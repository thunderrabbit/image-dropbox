If you're reading this it means you possibly already have the source, but if not...

Fetch a single branch for deployment:
http://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox/archives/master

Clone the entire repo if for some reason you want to:
git clone git://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox.git

Setup database -

*Change the obviously dummy information to match whatever you want*
CREATE DATABASE dropbox;
GRANT ALL ON dropbox.* TO dropbox@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dropbox';
mysql -uroot -p < schema.sql

Setup conf.php - 

edit the values in core/conf.php-sample to match your environment
mv core/conf.php{-sample,}

Adjust a few permissions -

PHP needs to be able to write to the cache directory so adjust the permissions accordingly
example:
chown www-data cache

Enjoy
