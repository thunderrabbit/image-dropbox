** Get a copy of image-dropbox **

If you're reading this it means you possibly already have the source, but if not...

Fetch a single branch for deployment:
http://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox/archives/master

OR

Clone the entire repo if for some reason you want to:
git clone git://github.com/nils42/image-dropbox.git

** Setup database **

*Change the obviously dummy information to match whatever you want*
CREATE DATABASE dropbox;
GRANT ALL ON dropbox.* TO dropbox@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dropbox';
mysql -uroot -p < schema.sql

OR

* visit install/ in web browser

OR

* copy+paste schema.sql into PHPMyAdmin

** Setup conf.php **

$ cp core/conf.php-sample core/conf.php

edit the values in core/conf.php to match your environment

settings for database

** Adjust a few permissions **

PHP needs to be able to write to the cache directory so adjust the permissions accordingly
example:
chown www-data cache

Currently the statistics output is dumped to a file core/stats.php which doesn't exist in the repo
touch core/stats.php
chown www-data core/stats.php

Enjoy
